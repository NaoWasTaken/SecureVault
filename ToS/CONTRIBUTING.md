## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Maintain the existing code style

### Testing

Before submitting a PR, please test:

- ✅ Creating a new vault
- ✅ Adding/editing/deleting passwords
- ✅ Password generator
- ✅ Import/export functionality
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Lock/unlock functionality
- ✅ Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (if possible)

### Security Considerations

Since this is a password manager:

- Never weaken encryption
- Don't add any external API calls or tracking
- Keep the tool completely client-side
- Test security implications of any changes
- Document any security-related changes clearly
